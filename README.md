# DL_Let-s-Play-GANs
In this lab, you need to implement a conditional GAN to generate synthetic images according to multi-label conditions. Recall that we have seen the generation capability of VAE in the previous lab. To achieve higher generation capacity, especially in computer vision, generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed and has been widely applied on style transfer and image synthesis. In this lab, given a specific condition, your model should generate the corresponding synthetic images (see in Fig. 1). For example, given “red cube” and “blue cylinder”, your model should generate the synthetic images with red cube and blue cylinder and meanwhile, input your generated images to a pre-trained classifier for evaluation.
